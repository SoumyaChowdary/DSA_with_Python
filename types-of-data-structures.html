            Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science, essential for storing and organizing data. They can be broadly classified into various types, each serving unique purposes and applications. Let's dive into these types to understand their characteristics and real-world applications.

        <h2>1. Primitive vs. Non-Primitive Data Structures</h2>
        <!-- Content for Primitive vs. Non-Primitive Data Structures -->
        <h3>Primitive Data Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> These are basic data types that are atomic and cannot be broken down into simpler types.</li>
        <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> They have a fixed size, are usually smaller, and are represented as simple values in memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Ideal for simpler operations and storing single value data types like int, char, float, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Non-Primitive Data Structures -->
    <h3>Non-Primitive Data Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> More complex structures that can be decomposed into simpler, primitive data types.</li>
        <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Typically larger in size, can grow or shrink dynamically, and are represented as pointers to other memory locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Suited for complex operations and can be composed of multiple primitive data structures.</li>
    </ul>
        

        <h2>2. Built-In vs. User-Defined Data Structures</h2>
        <p>
            Non-primitive data structures can be Built-in or User-defined.
        </p>
        <!-- Content for Built-In vs. User-Defined Data Structures -->
        <h3>Built-In Data Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Predefined in programming languages and readily available for use without the need for external libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Python includes lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets as built-in data structures.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- User-Defined Data Structures -->
    <h3>User-Defined Data Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Created by users or developers using the available set of built-in data structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Structures like linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables can be user-defined.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>3. Linear vs. Non-Linear Data Structures</h2>
        <!-- Content for Linear vs. Non-Linear Data Structures -->
        <!-- Linear Data Structures -->
    <h3>Linear Data Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Elements are arranged in a sequential order.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Useful for representing data where the order of elements is critical, like in arrays, lists, queues, and stacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Non-Linear Data Structures -->
    <h3>Non-Linear Data Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Elements are not arranged sequentially but hierarchically.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Ideal for representing hierarchical relationships, as seen in trees and graphs.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Applications of Specific Data Structures</h2>
        <!-- Content for Real-World Applications -->
        <!-- Graphs -->
    <h3>Graphs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Invaluable in modeling networks like social networks, computer networks, and geographical maps. Graph algorithms are used in Google Maps to find the shortest paths between locations.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Stacks -->
    <h3>Stacks:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Widely used in undo mechanisms in software, managing function calls in programming, and in expression evaluation algorithms.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Why learn Data Structures?</h2>
        <!-- Content for Why learn Data Structures -->
        <p>
            Each data structure comes with its unique properties and is tailored for specific types of operations and applications. Understanding these differences is crucial for developers to choose the right structure for their specific needs, ensuring efficient and effective data handling. Whether it's a simple array or a complex graph, the correct data structure can make a significant difference in the performance of an application.
